# Relations

__NOTE: Currently Unimplemented__

Relations are used to specify the manner of connection between two elements, such as in "John's friend is Mary", the relation "isFriendOf". Much work is needed to implement relations, and currently is not the focus of the project. If relations are really important to you, then please let us know!
